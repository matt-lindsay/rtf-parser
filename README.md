# RTF Parsing Test

This project is a working code snippet of the rtf-parser npm module, which will be built into other projects.

The rtf-parser module splits each line item and whitespace item out into what looks like a JSON array. It then has to be recompiled in this instance to replicate a CSV record, starting a newline at the start of each record.
